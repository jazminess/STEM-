<h1>Confession to Crush</h1>
<p>Hey [Crush's Name],</p>
<p>I just wanted to let you know that I've had feelings for you for a while now. You're amazing and I couldn't keep this to myself any longer.</p>
<p>If you feel the same way, I'd love to chat more and see where things could go.</p>
<p>Hope to hear from you soon!</p>
